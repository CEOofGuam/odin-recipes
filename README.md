# Odin Recipes

This is a basic recipe website created as the first project in The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum.

The goal of the project was to practice fundamental HTML structure and elements to build a multi-page website with clear hierarchy and navigation.

The site is viewable live here: https://ceoofguam.github.io/odin-recipes/

## Features

- Main Index Page: Central homepage listing all available recipes.
- Three Recipe Pages: Separate HTML pages for each recipe.
- Basic Navigation: Links on the index to each recipe, as well as a "Home" link to navigate back.
- Structured Content: Proper use of headings, paragraphs, unordered and ordered lists.

## What I Learned

Although I had already learned the basics of HTML through progress in freeCodeCamp's HTML curriculum, the knowledge was implemented more effectively here:
- File structure: Setting up and navigating an organized folder and file structure for a multi-page site.
- Git & Github: Practicing the workflow of adding, committing, and pushing changes with commit messages.
- Hands-on with tools: Using an IDE (Visual Studio Code) in conjunction with a terminal (Ghostty) and a web browser (Arc).
