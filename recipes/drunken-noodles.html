    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Also known as Pad Kee Mao, this is a popular Thai stir fry noodle dish. 
        Kaitlin and I made this for the first time for a dinner with her parents, 
        with no previous experience cooking similar dishes or even most of the ingredients on this list. 
        However, it turned out beautiful and delicious.
