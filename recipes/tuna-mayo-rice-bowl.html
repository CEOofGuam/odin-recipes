    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A simple bowl of tuna, mayo, and rice, with modest seasoning. 
        Although lacking in fiber, this bowl of protein and carbs is incredibly quick to put together making it an easy go-to. 
        I've eaten this probably more often than I should, but I'm not worried about my mercury levels.

        <li>Furikake seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pack of nori sheets from Costco</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook 1 cup of white rice and scoop half into a bowl. Open the canned tuna and drain the water before placing atop rice.</li>
